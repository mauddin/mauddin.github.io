  abstract={A methodology is proposed for freight traffic assignment in large-scale road–rail intermodal networks. To obtain the user–equilibrium freight flows, a path-based assignment algorithm (gradient projection) was proposed. The developed methodology was tested on the U.S. intermodal network by using the 2007 freight demand for truck, rail, and road–rail intermodal from the Freight Analysis Framework, Version 3 (FAF3). The results indicate that the proposed methodology's projected flow pattern is similar to the FAF3 assignment. The proposed methodology can be used by transportation planners and decision makers to forecast freight flows and to evaluate strategic network expansion options.}

  abstract={This study examined the use of voice recognition technology in perioperative services (Periop) to enable Periop staff to record workflow milestones using mobile technology. The use of mobile technology to improve patient flow and quality of care could be facilitated if such voice recognition technology could be made robust. The goal of this experiment was to allow the Periop staff to provide care without being interrupted with data entry and querying tasks. However, the results are generalizable to other situations where an engineering manager attempts to improve communication performance using mobile technology. This study enhanced Google’s voice recognition capability by using post-processing classifiers (i.e., bag-of-sentences, support vector machine, and maximum entropy). The experiments investigated three factors (original phrasing, reduced phrasing, and personalized phrasing) at three levels (zero training repetition, 5 training repetitions, and 10 training repetitions). Results indicated that personal phrasing yielded the highest correctness and that training the device to recognize an individual’s voice improved correctness as well. Although simplistic, the bag-of-sentences classifier significantly improved voice recognition correctness. The classification efficiency of the maximum entropy and support vector machine algorithms was found to be nearly identical. These results suggest that engineering managers could significantly enhance Google’s voice recognition technology by using post-processing techniques, which would facilitate its use in health care and other applications.}

  abstract={Transportation apps are playing a positive role for today’s technology-driven users. They provide users with a convenient and flexible tool to access transportation data and services, as well as collect and manage data. In many of these apps, such as Google Maps, their operations rely on the effectiveness of the voice recognition system. For the existing and new apps to be truly effective, the built-in voice recognition system needs to be robust (i.e., being able to recognize words spoken in different pitch and tone). The goal of this study is to assess three post-processing classifiers (i.e., bag-of-sentences, support vector machine, and maximum entropy) to enhance the commonly used Google’s voice recognition system. The experiments investigated three factors (original phrasing, reduced phrasing, and personalized phrasing) at three levels (zero training repetition, 5 training repetitions, and 10 training repetitions).

  abstract={This paper presents a mathematical model for the routing of multicommodity freight in an intermodal network under disruptions. A stochastic mixed-integer program was formulated to minimize not only operational costs of various modes and transfer costs at terminals but also penalty costs associated with unsatisfied demands. The sample average approximation algorithm was used to solve this challenging problem. The developed model was then applied to two networks—a hypothetical 15-node network and an actual intermodal network in the Gulf Coast, Southeastern, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States—to demonstrate its applicability with explicit consideration of disruptions at links, nodes, and terminals. The model results indicated that during disruptions, goods in the study region should be shipped by road–rail intermodal network because of the built-in redundancy of the freight transport network. Additionally, the routes generated by the model were found to be more robust than those typically used by freight carriers.}

It uses 2009–2013 Ohio crash data from the Highway Safety Information System. The explanatory factors include the occupant, vehicle, collision, roadway, temporal and environmental characteristics. Six separate mixed logit models were developed considering three lighting conditions (daylight, dark, and dark-lighted) on two area types (rural and urban). A series of log-likelihood ratio tests were conducted to validate that these six separate models by lighting conditions and area types are warranted. The model results suggest major differences in both the combination and the magnitude of impact of variables included in each model. Some variables were significant only in one lighting condition but not in other conditions. Similarly, some variables were found to be significant in one area type but not in other area type. These differences show that the different lighting conditions and area types do in fact have different contributing effects on injury severity in truck-involved crashes, further highlighting the importance of examining crashes based on lighting conditions on rural and urban roadways. Age and gender of occupant (who is the most severely injured in a crash), truck types, AADT, speed, and weather condition were found to be factors that have significantly different levels of impact on injury severity in truck-involved crashes.}

Twenty pavement sections are selected from across the state, and historical pavement performance data of those sections are collected. A total of 8 models were developed based on regression techniques, which include 4 for Asphalt Concrete (AC) pavements and 4 for Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements (JPCP). Four different performance indicators are considered as response variables in the statistical analysis: Present Serviceability Index (PSI), Pavement Distress Index (PDI), Pavement Quality Index (PQI), and International Roughness Index (IRI). Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), Free Flow Speed (FFS), precipitation, temperature, and soil type (soil Type A from Blue Ridge and Piedmont Region, and soil Type B from Coastal Plain and Sediment Region) are considered as predictor variables. Results showed that AADT, FFS, and precipitation have statistically significant effects on PSI and IRI for both JPCP and AC pavements. Temperature showed significant effect only on PDI and PQI (p < 0.01) for AC pavements. Considering soil type, Type B soil produced statistically higher PDI and PQI (p < 0.01) compared to Type A soil on AC pavements; whereas, Type B soil produced statistically higher IRI and PSI (p < 0.001) compared to Type A soil on JPCP pavements. Using the developed models, local transportation agencies could estimate future corrective actions, such as maintenance and rehabilitation, as well as future pavement performances.}

  abstract={With the growth of intermodal freight transportation, it is important that transportation planners and decision makers are knowledgeable about freight flow data to make informed decisions. This is particularly true with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) offering new capabilities to intermodal freight transportation. Specifically, ITS enables access to multiple different data sources, but they have different formats, resolution, and timescales. Thus, knowledge of data science is essential to be successful in future ITS-enabled intermodal freight transportation system. This chapter discusses the commonly used descriptive and predictive data analytic techniques in intermodal freight transportation applications. These techniques cover the entire spectrum of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. In addition to illustrating how to apply these techniques through relatively simple examples, this chapter will also show how to apply them using the statistical software R. Additional exercises are provided for those who wish to apply the described techniques to more complex problems.}

  abstract={Background: In production environments, a countdown timer is used to report the status of the planned start time and to provide both a communication mechanism and an accountability aid.1 It has been used in the airline industry to remind all personnel of the remaining time until when the aircraft door should be closed. This study explored the effectiveness of a countdown timer in the operating room (OR).

Aims: This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a countdown timer in the OR setting and to determine the factors that contribute to prolonged OR turnover time (TOT) (defined to be from the “procedure finish” time of the preceding case to the “procedure start” time of the following case), as well as the impact each of the significant factors has on TOT. In this study, the term case denotes a surgical procedure.

Method: An Android app named ORTimer was developed for the study. The app was installed on Android tablets that were placed at the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) workstations in the OR at Greenville Memorial Hospital (GMH) in South Carolina. The CRNAs helped collect the event milestones and record the delay reasons (if applicable). Additional OR case information was extracted from GMH’s electronic medical record. Regression analysis was used to identify significant factors that contribute to prolonged OR TOT and to estimate their impacts. A t-test was conducted to test the hypothesis that the use of a countdown timer is effective in an OR environment.

Results: The data from a total of 232 cases where the ORTimer app was used were examined. Among the factors (i.e., delay reasons and case information) considered, an outpatient from a following case had the highest correlation with excessive room idle time, which is the difference between the actual TOT and the allotted TOT. Delays due to patient-related issues added about 12.7 minutes to the turnover time (90% CI: 7.2, 18.3) when other factors were fixed. Delays due to preoperative-related issues added about 27.4 minutes to the turnover time (90% CI: 20.0, 34.7) when other factors were fixed.

Conclusions: As is the case with most production environments,1 the use of a visual management tool such as the countdown timer in the OR is found to be effective. Additional research is needed to determine whether this finding is applicable to other hospitals.}

It uses the crash data in the state of California from the Highway Safety Information System, from 2005 to 2011. The explanatory factors include the occupant, crash, vehicle, roadway, environmental, and temporal characteristics. Both fixed- and random-parameters ordered probit models of injury severity (where possible outcomes are major, minor, and no injury) were estimated; the random-parameters model captures possible unobserved effects related to factors not present in the data. The model results indicate that the occupants being male, truck drivers, crashes occurring in rural locations, under dark-unlighted, under dark-lighted conditions, and on weekdays were associated with increased probability of major injuries. Conversely, the older occupants (age 60 and over), truck making a turn, rear-end collision, collision with an object, crashes occurring on non-interstate highway, higher speed limit highway (≥65 mph), and flat terrain were associated with decreased probability of major injuries. This study has identified factors that explain injury severities of crashes involving HAZMAT, and as such, it could be used by policy makers and transportation agencies to improve HAZMAT transport, and thus, the overall highway safety.}

However, no study to date has analyzed crashes in Ohio in order to explore the factors contributing to the pedestrian injury severity resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This study fills this gap by investigating the crashes involving pedestrians exclusively in Ohio. This study uses the crash data from the Highway Safety Information System, from 2009 to 2013. The explanatory factors include the pedestrian, driver, vehicle, crash, and roadway characteristics. Both fixed- and random-parameters ordered probit models of injury severity (where possible outcomes are major, minor, and possible/no injury) were estimated. The model results indicate that older pedestrian (65 and over), younger driver (less than 24), driving under influence (DUI), struck by truck, dark-unlighted roadways, six-lane roadways, and speed limits of 40 mph and 50 mph were all factors associated with more severe injuries to the pedestrians. Conversely, older driver (65 and over), passenger car, crash occurring in urban locations, daytime traffic off-peak (10 a.m. to 3:59 p.m.), weekdays, and daylight condition were all factors associated with less severe injuries. This study provides specific safety recommendations so that effective countermeasures can be developed and implemented by policy makers, which in turn will improve overall highway safety.}

  abstract={Background: Improving operating room (OR) utilization is crucial to hospitals. This study examines the effectiveness of a mobile application co-developed with hospital staff to track OR turnover time (TOT).

Methods: An Android-based app, named ORTimer, was used by staff in two OR units (GI-Lab and D-Core) of Greenville Memorial Hospital (GMH) in South Carolina. The staff used the app to record milestones and note delay reasons (if applicable). A total of 1,782 turnover observations from the GI-Lab and 694 turnover observations from the D-Core were collected for the study. Using data collected from the app and additional information from GMH’s electronic medical record system, a two-sample proportionality test was conducted to test the hypothesis that the use of the app improved OR turnover performance (i.e., the TOT is equal to or less than the allotted time).

Results: The result of the hypothesis test indicates that a higher percentage of observations in the GI-Lab and D-Core met their turnover target time when the ORTimer app was used. Additionally, multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant factors that contribute to prolonged OR TOT and to estimate their impacts.

Conclusions: The app serves as both a visual management tool as well as a TOT data collection tool. By identifying barriers to the on-time completion of the turnaround, the app allows for continuous improvement of the turnover process.}

  abstract={Transportation infrastructures, particularly those supporting intermodal freight, are vulnerable to natural disasters and man-made disasters that could lead to severe service disruptions. These disruptions can drastically degrade the capacity of a transportation mode and consequently have adverse impacts on intermodal freight transport and freight supply chain. To address service disruption, this paper develops a model to reliably route freight in a road-rail intermodal network. Specifically, the model seeks to provide the optimal route via road segments (highway links), rail segments (rail lines), and intermodal terminals for freight when the network is subject to capacity uncertainties. To ensure reliability, the model plans for reduced network link, node, and intermodal terminal capacity. A major contribution of this work is that a framework is provided to allow decision makers to determine the amount of capacity reduction to consider in planning routes to obtain a user-specified reliability level. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a real-world intermodal network in the Gulf Coast, Southeastern, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is found that the total system cost increases with the level of capacity uncertainty and with increased confidence levels for disruptions at links, nodes, and intermodal terminals.}

  abstract={Freight activities are directly related to a country’s Gross Domestic Product and economic viability. In recent years, the U.S. transportation system supports a growing volume of freight, and it is anticipated that this trend will continue in the coming years. To support the projected increase in freight volume, an efficient, reliable, and low-cost freight logistics system is necessary to keep the U.S. competitive in the global market. In addition, intermodal transport is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to shippers, and this trend is likely to continue as state and federal agencies are considering policies to induce a freight modal shift from road to intermodal to alleviate highway congestion and emissions. However, the U.S. intermodal freight transport network is vulnerable to various disruptions. A disruptive event can be a natural disaster or a man- made disaster. A number of such disasters have occurred recently that severely impacted the freight transport network. To this end, this dissertation presents four studies where mathematical models are developed for the road-rail intermodal freight transport considering the network uncertainties.

The first study proposes a methodology for freight traffic assignment in large- scale road-rail intermodal networks. To obtain the user-equilibrium freight flows, gradient projection (GP) algorithm is proposed. The developed methodology is tested on the U.S. intermodal network using the 2007 freight demands for truck, rail, and road-rail intermodal from the Freight Analysis Framework, version 3, (FAF3). The results indicate that the proposed methodology’s projected flow pattern is similar to the FAF3 assignment. The second study formulates a stochastic model for the aforementioned freight traffic assignment problem under uncertainty. To solve this challenging problem, an algorithmic framework, involving the sample average approximation and GP algorithm, is proposed. The experiments consider four types of natural disasters that have different risks and impacts on the transportation network: earthquake, hurricane, tornado, and flood. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the model and algorithmic framework to obtain freight flows for a realistic-sized network in reasonable time.

The third study presents a model for the routing of multicommodity freight in an intermodal network under disruptions. A stochastic mixed integer program is formulated, which minimizes not only operational costs of different modes and transfer costs at terminals but also penalty costs associated with unsatisfied demands. The routes generated by the model are found to be more robust than those typically used by freight carriers.

Lastly, the fourth study develops a model to reliably route freight in a road-rail intermodal network. Specifically, the model seeks to provide the optimal route via road segments, rail segments, and intermodal terminals for freight when the network is subject to capacity uncertainties. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a real-world intermodal network in the Gulf Coast, Southeastern, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S.}

  abstract={This paper presents a methodology for freight traffic assignment in a large-scale road-rail intermodal network under uncertainty. Network uncertainties caused by natural disasters have dramatically increased in recent years. Several of these disasters (e.g., Hurricane Sandy, Mississippi River Flooding, Hurricane Harvey) severely disrupted the U.S. freight transport network, and consequently, the supply chain. To account for these network uncertainties, a stochastic freight traffic assignment model is formulated. An algorithmic framework, involving the sample average approximation and gradient projection algorithm, is proposed to solve this challenging problem. The developed methodology is tested on the U.S. intermodal network with freight flow data from the Freight Analysis Framework. The experiments consider four types of natural disasters that have different risks and impacts on the transportation network: earthquake, hurricane, tornado, and flood. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the model and algorithmic framework to obtain freight flows for a realistic-sized network in reasonable time (between 417 and 716 minutes). It is found that for all disaster scenarios the freight ton-miles are higher compared to the base case without uncertainty. The increase in freight ton-miles is the highest under the flooding scenario; this is due to the fact that there are more states in the flood-risk areas and they are scattered throughout the U.S.}

  abstract={This paper investigates truck-involved crashes to determine the statistically significant factors that contribute to injury severity under different weather conditions. The analysis uses crash data from the state of Ohio between 2011 and 2015 available from the Highway Safety Information System. To determine if weather conditions should be considered separately for truck safety analyses, parameter transferability tests are conducted; the results suggest that weather conditions should be modeled separately with a high level of statistical confidence. To this end, three separate mixed logit models are estimated for three different weather conditions: normal, rain and snow. The estimated models identify a variety of statistically significant factors influencing the injury severity. Different weather conditions are found to have different contributing effects on injury severity in truck-involved crashes. Rural, rear-end and sideswipe crash parameters were found to have significantly different levels of impact on injury severity. Based on the findings of this study, several countermeasures are suggested: 1) safety and enforcement programs should focus on female truck drivers, 2) a variable speed limit sign should be used to lower speeds of trucks during rainy condition, and 3) trucks should be restricted or prohibited on non-interstates during rainy and snowy conditions. These countermeasures could reduce the number and severity of truck-involved crashes under different weather conditions.}

  abstract={In recent years, intermodal transport has become an increasingly attractive alternative to freight shippers. However, the current intermodal freight transport is not as efficient as it could be. Oftentimes an empty container needs to be transported from the empty container depot to the shipper, and conversely, an empty container needs to be transported from the receiver to the empty container depot. These empty container movements decrease the freight carrier’s profit, as well as increase traffic congestion, decrease roadway safety, and add unnecessary emissions to the environment. To this end, our study evaluates a potential collaboration strategy to be used by carriers for domestic intermodal freight transport based on an optimization approach to reduce the number of empty container trips. A binary integer-linear programming model is developed to determine each freight carrier’s optimal schedule while minimizing its operating cost. The model ensures that the cost for each carrier with collaboration is less than or equal to its cost without collaboration. It also ensures that average savings from the collaboration are shared equally among all participating carriers. Additionally, two stochastic models are provided to account for uncertainty in truck travel times. The proposed collaboration strategy is tested using empirical data and is demonstrated to be effective in meeting all of the shipment constraints.}

Students in the field of transportation engineering should be ready upon their graduation with new knowledge and skills that are compatible with the need of the industry and sustainable engineering practices.During summers of 2018 and 2019, we developed and implemented an eight-week program to increase the knowledge and skills of students coming from multidisciplinary fields related to autonomous vehicles. Problem of “How much will platooning reduce fuel consumption and emissions per vehicle mile traveled?” was instrumentalized in subsequent activities to introduce the comprehensive knowledge structure of autonomous vehicles.The engineering concept of reducing the cost and sustainability was embedded in the leading research question that helped us to develop and implement activities on an overall knowledge structure in autonomous vehicles. The goal of using problem-based learning activities was not to encourage the students to focus on reaching the solution merely. We aimed to introduce the multidisciplinary knowledge and critical skills aspects of learning about disruptive technologies.In this paper, we will discuss how a multidisciplinary research approach was incorporated into a problem-based learning activity. The students were introduced the subjects related to math, physics, computer science, and biology as the integration of the knowledge structure of autonomous vehicles. We will also present the results on students’ use of critical skills such as machine learning and computer programming.}

  abstract={Efficient use of the operating room (OR) is crucial for any hospital. One of the major inefficiencies in the OR is surgical cases not starting or finishing on time as scheduled. When a case is delayed, it affects all subsequent cases in that OR. This study uses discrete choice analysis to determine the significant factors, including team familiarity, that influence OR case on-time start and finish. A case is considered on-time if the documented procedure start and finish times are no more than 10 minutes after the scheduled start and finish times. The analysis uses surgical case data from a large tertiary referral hospital and academic center in Greenville, South Carolina. The case data includes all surgical cases (15,091) performed during regular workdays in 2013. Two binary logit models are developed: one for case on-time start and one for case on-time finish. Results indicate that higher team familiarity between surgeon and anesthesiologist, surgeon and circulating nurse, surgeon and scrub nurse, and surgeon and CRNA improve the likelihood of an OR case on-time start and on-time finish. This finding indicates that the OR scheduling staff in the study hospital make a concerted effort to schedule the surgical teams with members who have worked well together in the past.}

  abstract={This study explores the usefulness of machine learning classifiers for modeling freight mode choice. We investigate eight commonly used machine learning classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification and Regression Tree, Random Forest, Boosting and Bagging, along with the classical Multinomial Logit model. US 2012 Commodity Flow Survey data are used as the primary data source; we augment it with spatial attributes from secondary data sources. The performance of the classifiers is compared based on prediction accuracy results. The current research also examines the role of sample size and training-testing data split ratios on the predictive ability of the various approaches. In addition, the importance of variables is estimated to determine how the variables influence freight mode choice. The results show that the tree-based ensemble classifiers perform the best. Specifically, Random Forest produces the most accurate predictions, closely followed by Boosting and Bagging. With regard to variable importance, shipment characteristics, such as shipment distance, industry classification of the shipper and shipment size, are the most significant factors for freight mode choice decisions.}

  abstract={The use of hydrogen as an alternative transportation fuel has gained much interest in recent years. Hydrogen can be utilized in electric vehicles equipped with hydrogen powertrains (including hydrogen internal combustion engines or fuel cells). Given that most of the freight in the U.S. is transported via diesel trucks, transition to hydrogen fuel would help achieve significant environmental benefits as well as accelerate the decarbonization of the freight transportation sector. This paper presents the methodology and results of a case study on modeling freight traffic demand and highway networks based on publicly available data for the Interstate 75 freight corridor. The purpose of this study is to prepare input traffic and network data that can support the planning of a hydrogen fueling station infrastructure. In particular, the data can be used for siting and characterizing an optimized framework of hydrogen fueling stations from candidate diesel stations along the Interstate 75 corridor. The methodologies developed and presented in this paper may be readily expanded and applied to any transport corridor given the data availability. This paper is the first in a series that will build out a comprehensive model to optimize a consolidated national hydrogen refueling infrastructure eco-system targeted at commercial vehicles.}
